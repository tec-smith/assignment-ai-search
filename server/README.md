[<- Go back](https://github.com/tec-smith/assignment-ai-search)

- **Data Storage and Retrieval:** The backend handles the storage and retrieval of data from a database or other data source. This includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data entities.
- **API Endpoints:** The backend exposes API endpoints that allow frontend applications to interact with the data and functionality provided by the backend. These endpoints can be used to perform various operations, such as fetching data, creating new records, or updating existing ones.
- **Data Validation and Security:** The backend implements data validation and security measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data. This includes input validation, authentication, and authorization mechanisms.
- **Background Tasks and Processing:** The backend can handle background tasks and processing, such as scheduled jobs, data processing pipelines, or event-driven functions. These tasks can be executed asynchronously without blocking the main application flow.
- **Integration with External Services:** The backend can integrate with external services, such as payment gateways, email providers, or third-party APIs. This allows the application to leverage the functionality of these services without having to implement them directly.
- **Scalability and Performance:** The backend is designed to be scalable and performant, handling a high volume of requests and data while maintaining acceptable response times. This may involve implementing load balancing, caching mechanisms, or distributed architectures.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** The backend includes monitoring and logging capabilities to track its performance, identify errors, and facilitate debugging. This information can be used to improve the stability and reliability of the application.
