## Assignment Briefing

This task is to create a proof of concept for a free-form textual input search, as an alternative to our normal search bar where you specify location, dates, and travelers.

The search input should present the relevant understood information and offer ways to correct it, perhaps inline. When all input is done, the user should be redirected to the existing search flow.

## Technical Requirements

Frontend part should be a React component that we can insert into our existing frontend. adaptive to its surrounding dimensions. It may be shown like the current search bar (switching between the two) or perhaps in a widget, so the size available could be tiny or very large.

Backend part should be a minimal Node Express server.
As for which AI API to use, is up to you. Natural
Language or Vertex APIs might be interesting?
